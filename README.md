Kobble allows you to create items in a Tree format such as links, file folders, documents and presentations.
Kobble uses a data model similar to YouTube or Spotify to organize data within a Tree containing Channels and what we call Tracks - which is simply a collection of items relating to your projects.
Channels can hold items related to topics of interest and Tracks help you organize your items by project. 
The versatility of the Kobble Tree allows you to organize, copy and rearrange your Channels and Tracks however you want.

### Kobble data storage
Kobble stores all of your data on [GitHub](https://github.com) in *your personal account*. 
You control all your data, and you can decide if you want your data to be private or public.
All of your data is sent directly from your browser to GitHub, so it is never stored on our servers-- the data actually completely bypasses our servers, so we never see any of your data unless you decide to make your data public.
Depending on how you decide to log in, your Kobble data will be stored in a Secret Gist, a Public Repo, or a Private Repo.
Kobble uses a data model similar to YouTube or Spotify to organize data within a Tree containing Channels and what we call Tracks - which is simply a collection of items relating to your projects.
Your data can be edited, updated and controlled both through your personal Kobble environment as well as through GitHub
Because your data is stored and backed up in GitHub, you will never lose your data.
