# Welcome to Kobble
Kobble is an amazingly versatile productivity environment that is just what you have been looking for!
Kobble is so unique, that you may not have ever seen anything like it before.
We call it Kobble, because you can Kobble together a variety of things that were once scattered in various different places, and then bring it all together into one place.
So, let's start with a brief description of what Kobble is all about.

### Kobble increases productivity for everyone
Kobble is designed for just about anyone to use.
Students, researchers, and professionals will find Kobble especially useful to keep track of projects and data.
If you like to keep a lot of information on a variety of topics of interest to you, Kobble was made with you in mind!
From organizing your internet bookmarks; to gathering internet research; to presenting your information, Kobble has just what you need to get the job done.
If you are a creative, productive person, then Kobble is right for you!

### Kobble can be used for a variety of purposes
With Kobble, you can easily create content for a variety of purposes.
You can keep all your data in Kobble such as study notes, projects, internet research, reports, and presentations.
Kobble also helps you increase your productivity as you browse the internet collecting information for your research projects.
You can also keep images, videos and all other project related links and notes all together in one place.
You can even stream archived books and view them in your Kobble environment.

### Kobble allows you to organize the way you want to
The Kobble environment allows you to keep your internet links organized just the way you want them.
You can drag and drop your links right into your personal Kobble environment.
Kobble allows you to create items in a Tree format such as links, file folders, documents and presentations.
Kobble uses a data model similar to YouTube or Spotify to organize data within a Tree containing Channels and what we call Tracks - which is simply a collection of items relating to your projects.
Channels can hold items related to topics of interest and Tracks help you organize your items by project. 
The versatility of the Kobble Tree allows you to organize, copy and rearrange your Channels and Tracks however you want.
You can create an unlimited number of Channels and Tracks to organize your work.

### Share and collaborate with Kobble
You can easily share whole Channels of information with people who are interested in your work. Sharing Kobble Channels with people you are collaborating with on your projects is so easy.


### Kobble uses Markdown format
Documents and presentations in your Kobble environment are formatted using Markdown, an easy to use and versitile syntax.  The benefits of Markdown is that it is platform independent, intuitive to use, uses plain text, provides basic formatting, and is easily converted to HTML.

### Kobble data storage using GitHub
Kobble stores all of your data on [GitHub](https://github.com) in *your personal account*. 
For those familiar with GitHub, you will love this! Perhaps, GitHub is new to other users, but you will soon see the benefits of having all your data stored and backed up so easily. You will have stress free storage and the confidence that your data is never lost. GitHub is easy to use and keeps everything updated as you edit. It also keeps all of your revisions!
You control all your data, and you can decide if you want your data to be private or public.
All of your data is sent directly from your browser to GitHub, so it is never stored on our servers-- the data actually completely bypasses our servers, so nobody else ever sees any of your data unless you decide to make your data public.
Those who like privacy, will really like the fact that you can keep your personal information private.
Depending on how you decide to log in, your Kobble data will be stored in a Secret Gist, a Public Repo, or a Private Repo.
Your data can be edited, updated and controlled both through your personal Kobble environment as well as through GitHub
Because your data is stored and backed up in GitHub, you will never lose your Kobble data.

### Just imagine what you can do with Kobble
Just imagine how much more productive you will be by having control over how your data is collected, created, presented, stored and shared!

Kobble gives you mastery over all stages of your productivity: from the conception of your ideas; to beginning to gather information; to then collaborating with others; and finally to the completion of your projects in a final presentation. All this, in a format that can easily be shared with others at any stage of your project... or kept private.
