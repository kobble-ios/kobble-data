### Kobble data storage using GitHub
Kobble stores all of your data on [GitHub](https://github.com) in *your personal account*. 
For those familiar with GitHub, you will love this! Perhaps GitHub is new to other users, but you will soon see the benefits of having all your data stored and backed up so easily. You will have stress free storage and the security that your data is never lost. GitHub is easy to use and keeps everything updated as you edit. It also keeps all of your revisions!
You control all your data, and you can decide if you want your data to be private or public.
All of your data is sent directly from your browser to GitHub, so it is never stored on our servers-- the data actually completely bypasses our servers, so nobody else ever sees any of your data unless you decide to make your data public.
Those who like privacy, will really like the fact that you can keep your personal information private.
Depending on how you decide to log in, your Kobble data will be stored in a Secret Gist, a Public Repo, or a Private Repo.
Your data can be edited, updated and controlled both through your personal Kobble environment as well as through GitHub.

Kobble gives you mastery over all stages of your creative process and productivity: starting from the conception of your ideas; to gathering information; to then collaborating with others; up to the completion of your projects in a final presentation; and finally, to sharing your finished product with others. Once you see what you can do with Kobble, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.
