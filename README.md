### Kobble data storage using GitHub
Kobble stores all of your data on [GitHub](https://github.com) in *your personal account*. 
For those already familiar with GitHub, you will love this! Perhaps GitHub is new to other users, but you will soon see the benefits of having all your data stored and backed up so easily. You will have stress free storage with the security that your data is never lost. GitHub is easy to use and keeps everything updated as you edit. Your data can be edited, updated and controlled both through your personal GitHub account as well as through your personal Kobble environment. GitHub also keeps all of your revisions!

### Share and Collaborate or Keep it private with Kobble
Some people like privacy; some people like sharing and collaborating; and some people like a little of both. Kobble has the versatility for sharing as much or as little as you want. You can keep your information private, and yet still easily share whole Channels of information with people who are interested in your work. 
Sharing Kobble Channels with people you are collaborating with on your projects is effortless. With Kobble, you control all your data, so you can decide if you want your data to be private or public. 
Your Kobble data can be stored in a Secret Gist, a Public Repo, or a Private Repo. 
All of your data is sent directly from your browser to GitHub, so it is never stored on our servers. 
Your data actually completely bypasses our servers, so if you choose a Private Repo, nobody else ever sees any of your data unless you decide to make it public.

### Just imagine what you can do with Kobble
Just imagine how much more productive you will be by having control over how your data is collected, created, presented, stored and shared!
Kobble gives you mastery over all stages of your creative process and productivity: starting from the conception of your ideas; to gathering information; to then collaborating with others; up to the completion of your projects in a final presentation; and finally, to sharing your finished product with others. 
Once you see what you can do with Kobble, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.
