### Terms

By accessing this web site or app, you are agreeing to be bound by these 
	Terms of Use, all applicable laws and regulations, 
	and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local 
	laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from 
	using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this web site or app are 
	protected by applicable copyright, patent, and trade mark law.

### Use License

The paid subscriptions may have quotas that are described when purchasing the subscription. Permission is granted to use Kobble within the quotas of your subscription. 

This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

1. modify or copy the materials
2. use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
3. attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Kobb's web site;
4. remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials;
5. transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.
6. if Kobble software or additions are noted to be in 'beta', then you cannot blog, write, or publish comments about beta software without the written consent of Kobble.
		
This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Kobble at any time. 

### Disclaimer

The materials and software on Kobble's web site and app are provided "as is". Kobble makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, Kobble does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials or software on its web site or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

### Content Limitations

Violations of any of the categories of prohibited content or behavior described below will result in termination of your account.

#### Adult Content

We do allow adult content on Kobble, including images or videos that contain nudity or sexual activity. 

#### Child safety 

We have a zero-tolerance policy towards content that exploits children. Some examples of this include:

1. Child sexual abuse imagery: We will terminate the accounts of any user we find publishing or distributing child sexual abuse imagery. We will also report that user to law enforcement.
2. Pedophilia: We do not allow content that encourages or promotes sexual attraction towards children. For example, do not create blogs with galleries of images of children where the collection of images or text accompanying the images is sexually suggestive, and do not publish content of a sexual nature involving an underage participant.

#### Hate Speech 
Kobble is a platform for free expression. But we don't support content that promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of these core characteristics. This can be a delicate balancing act, but if the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content crosses the line.

#### Crude Content 
Don't post content just to be shocking or graphic. For example, collections of close-up images of gunshot wounds or accident scenes without additional context or commentary would violate this policy.

#### Violence 
Don't threaten other people on your blog. For example, don't post death threats against another person or group of people and don't post content encouraging your readers to take violent action against another person or group of people.

#### Harassment 
Do not harass or bully others. Anyone using Blogger to harass or bully may have the offending content removed or be permanently banned from the site. Online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have serious offline consequences.

#### Copyright
It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement. More information about our copyright procedures can be found here. Also, please don't provide links to sites where your readers can obtain unauthorized downloads of other people's content.

####  Malware and viruses 
Do not create blogs that transmit viruses, cause pop-ups, attempt to install software without the reader's consent, or otherwise impact readers with malicious code. This is strictly forbidden on Blogger.

### Limitations

In no event shall Kobble or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials or software on Kobble's web site or app, even if a Kobble authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
