## Data Organization
::: slide
Kobble organises data into channels, tracks, and items, similar to YouTube or Spotify. The main difference is that the items in Kobble are not just videos or songs, but can be bookmarks, markdown documents, presentations, and more. { .left }

## GitHub Support
::: slide
If you purchase GitHub support, then *ALL* of your data is stored in your GitHub account, rather than on your device. This also enables sharing of channels and tracks to any user with access to the GitHub repo where your data resides. { .left }

::: slide 
Kobble supports public and private repos. Public repos are useful for sharing your Kobble creations with anyone. In fact, the Kobble presentation you are looking at now is in a public GitHub repo. Private repos are great for your private information. { .left }

To purchase GitHub support, tap the home button and select the GitHub tab.

## Tabbed Viewers
::: slide
Selecting an item opens it in a tabbed viewer. The specific view presented depends on the type of item. Markdown and presentation items are shown in a split view so that you can edit the contents. Bookmarks open the web page. { .left }
